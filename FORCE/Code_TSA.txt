# Time Series
Time Series products have as many bands as there are available or requested time steps. If no temporal subset was specified:
  - the TSS product contains one band per available acquisition (this may vary between the tiles),
  - the RMS product contains one band per available acquisition (this may vary between the tiles),
  - the TSI product contains one band per interpolation step,
  - the FBY product contains one band per year (do not overdo YEAR_MIN/MAX, this will give many useless bands),
  - the FBM product contains one band per month (up to 12, depends on MONTH_MIN/MAX and DOY_MIN/MAX),
  - the FBW contains one band per week (up to 52, depends on MONTH_MIN/MAX and DOY_MIN/MAX),
  - the FBD product contains one band per DOY (up to 365, depends on MONTH_MIN/MAX and DOY_MIN/MAX),
  - the 26 LSP products contain one band per year (do not overdo YEAR_MIN/MAX, this will give many useless bands)

# Basic Statistics
The Basic Statistics (STA) product provides a summary of all observations (or the requested subset). It is a multi-layer
image with following bands:
  - 1 µ Average of index values
  - 2 σ Standard deviation of index values
  - 3 min Minimum index value
  - 4 max Maximum index value
  - 5 # of obs. Number of good quality observations

# Trend Analysis
The Trend Analysis (TRD) product contains trend parameters. It is a multi-layer image with following bands:
  - 1 µ Average
  - 2 a Intercept
  - 3 b Trend
  - 4 R² R squared
  - 5 sig. Significance (-1, 0, 1)
  - 6 RMSE Root Mean Squared Error
  - 7 MAE Mean Absolute Error
  - 8 max |e| Maximum Absolute Residual
  - 9 # of obs. Number of good quality observations

# Change, Aftereffect, Trend
The Change, Aftereffect, Trend (CAT) product (following Hird et al. 2016, DOI: 10.1109/jstars.2015.2419594) contains
extended change and trend parameters. It detects one change per time series, splits the time series into three parts, and derives trend
parameters: (1) complete time series (this is the same as the TRD product), (2) time series before change, and (3) time series after
change. It is a multi-layer image with following bands:
  - 1 Change Magnitude of change
  - 2 Time of change Timestamp of the change (depends on the input time series, i.e. year/month/week/day)
  - 3–11 Trend parameters for complete time series (see TRD product)
  - 12–20 Trend parameters for time series before change (see TRD product)
  - 21–29 Trend parameters for time series after change (see TRD product)
